# SpotifyStatistics
This app use the spotify API to display statistics about the music you listen to

# Requirements
To know what packages are needed to run this app, see the file "requirement.txt"

To run the app, you will be asked these:
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID
    SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET
    SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI
To get them, you will either need to ask mine, or create your own application (there: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and get your own.
Then you will need to set them in the console:
    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=' ... '
    export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=' ... '
    export SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI=' ... '
