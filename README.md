To know what packages are needed to run this app, see the file "requirement.txt"

To run the app, you will be asked this:
- SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET
      
To get it, you will either need to ask mine, or create your own application (there: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and get your own.
Then you will need to set it in the console:  
```shell
$ export SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=' ... ' 
```
